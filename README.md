## Vb InLine ASM


</div>

### Description

Yep... "Toy 4 Dummies"... So, this here is a VB6 Add-In that runs silently in the background and makes it possible to add functions coded in Assembly Lang. directly to VB projects. No preprocessing of the ASM code is necessary unlike the CallWindowProc method. It does require MASM to do the compile at build time. There is no way to use VB's native compiler to do this. It just is not possible. There are other restrictions as well. They are documented in the ReadMe.txt file. Instructions on set-up are also in the ReadMe as well as an URL to a site to get MASM. I've included a few test projects and a couple of tutorials. Have to Upload in a different zip cuz PSC is rejecting the zip with everything. The String project was not as successful as I would have liked, but then, I've learned just enough ASM to be really dangerous 8~). Special thanks to Robert Rayment for the ASM projects he's shared in the past. Those VBP's were a big help in getting this debugged and running properly as well as increasing my ASM knowledge..... Tested and working with VB6 on Nt4 & W2K. Previous problems and crashes are documented in the ReadMe.txt so if you have a problem check there first...&#9689;
