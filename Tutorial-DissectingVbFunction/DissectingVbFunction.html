Why in the world would we want to do that?&nbsp; Well, some of us are just
plain curious.... 8)&nbsp; Knowing what VB is doing behind the "Curtain"
is something that intrigues. And, when combining VB and ASM, tearing apart
a function to see if it can be optimized is ... the whole purpose in using
ASM+VB in the first place. Making that Speed Critical section of code faster
and smaller. We will be dissecting a simple function in a standard module.
Take a look at a class module sometime and you will be amazed at all the
code that is added to a 1 line function. But then, you know classes are
slower... Right?

<P>So to start, Open the "DissectVbFunc.vbp" project and take a look at
the function in the module:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>Public Function DissectThis(iArg As Long) As Long
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DissectThis = iArg / 2
<BR>End Function
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
Real simple.... Just a divide by 2. There is no #ASM tag in this code so
the compiler will not generate an ASM code listing without being explicitly
told to do so.
<BR>To set that option, open the Inline ineterface, "Change Settings",
check the option: "Listings For All Modules".
<BR>Build the EXE.
<BR>In the "AsmListings-Logs" folder will now be 2 files, 1 for the form
and 1 for the module.
<BR>Open the Module Listing : "DissectingVbFunc.lst" with NotePad.
<BR>Scroll down and find our function, the beginning will be this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>?DissectThis@MDissect@@AAGXXZ PROC NEAR&nbsp;&nbsp; ; MDissect::DissectThis,
COMDAT

<P>; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Public Function DissectThis(iArg As Long) As
Long
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
The actual code is next. The machine code listing is necessary for the
VbInline add-in to parse out any un-named variables that VB may add.
<BR>Notice that VB is using floating point ASM commands when we are putting
in a long and expecting a long back..... And this is with the "Optimize
for FAST Code" setting on the VB compiler. Also, several calls are (or
can be) made to external VB runtime dll. Of course, as you know, dividing
by 2 in ASM is a 1 line operation.... shr eax, 1 . Just shift the bytes
in the register right 1 place....

<P>Just "For the Fun of It", open the form listing in NotePad. "Form1.lst".
The cmd button is the only thing on the form so scrolling down thru the
listing you see all the code that VB puts in the click event. Some of it
is for the msgbox. Near the top of the sub you will see the local variables
which appear like this:
<BR>_unnamed_var1$ = -24
<BR>Notice that all the vars are named "_unnamed_var1$ ". VB keeps track
of these internally so when we do an ASM Inline compile the add-in must
rename the variables and then go into the code body and determine which
variable goes where.... Another point of "interest" is this bit of code
"DWORD PTR fs:__except_list". This is part of the Structured Error Handler
routine that VB adds to much of it's code. When doing a compile with MASM
it WILL produce an error so if it is found in any function code that is
tagged #ASM it will be removed. If somebody finds a way for MASM to compile
that, please let me know. Because of that only Class and Standard modules
are supported in this add-in and preferably not mixed VB functions with
ASM functions. Although sometimes mixed works ok. You just have to compile
the code and see if it errors out....JS
