'The only tricky move here is the copy memory statement. There are various ways to get
'the BSTR from the DLL into the BSTR called "sResult" here. I have chosen to do it by
'copying a pointer returned by the DLL call into the sResult.

'Note that some kind of pointer connection has to be done, because VB normally assumes
'that a string coming from a DLL call is a C-string and tries to translate it. You could
'potentially avoid this conversion problem with a type library--but then you would have
'to write the type library. If you are making a big "normal" DLL for VB you should take
'this course and learn how to write a type library for it. If you do that VB will just
'suck in BSTR and other OLE types like variants naturally and you can avoid pointer
'manipulation.
