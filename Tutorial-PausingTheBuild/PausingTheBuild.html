By pausing the build before assembly, we can modify the ASM code before
it is compiled into an OBJ file. Of course the original inline code in
the VB module can be changed also, but if the code is finished and we just
want to try a few changes, pausing the build can be quick without being
permanent. To start open the Pausing.VBP project. This is just a simple
little piece of code that returns a number. When run in the VBIDE it will
always return 0.

<P>The Inline code in the function "Testing" is as follows"
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>Public Function Testing() As Long

<P>'#ASM_START
<BR>'
<BR>'&nbsp; mov eax, 12345678&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;Put a number in EAX
<BR>'
<BR>'&nbsp; ret&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; Return with result in EAX
<BR>'#ASM_END

<P>End Function</UL>
The #ASM tags are needed so the add-in can find the assembly code. The
ASM block must be commented becuz
<BR>VB will give us syntax errors if not. The number to return is put into
the EAX register and the function is returned.

<P>Now, open the VbInline add-in interface and goto the "Change Settings"
page.

<P>To begin, make sure the "Pause Before Assembly" option is NOT checked.
<BR>We will do a compile without it first and check the EXE for proper
operation.

<P>So, check the "Keep Settings Up" option, then click the "Exit Settings"
button.

<P>Now do a compile of the project. You should not have received any error
messages.

<P>If you did, check the "VbInlineAsm.dbg" in the "AsmListings-Logs" folder
which will be in any project folder that Inline is run.
<BR>Look at the Assembler Output for description of errors. (This is assuming
the options are set for debugging...)

<P>Now run the EXE. Clicking the cmd button should give a msgbox with the
"12345678" return.

<P>If we want to change that to "87654321", we could just change it in
the Inline code or we can pause the build and modify the ASM file.

<P>Open the Vb Inline interface and check the option "Pause Before Assembly".

<P>Now build the EXE again. A msgbox will pop and notify that the "Breakpoint"
has been hit.

<P>It will ask if you want to open the ASM file with your editor. You can
click yes to automatically open the file or just find the
<BR>file with Explorer and open it with NotePad. For the rest of this tutorial
I'll assume NotePad is used.
<BR>The file is "Pausing.asm" in the "AsmListings-Logs" folder. If you
manually opened it, don't click No yet.

<P>Got it open? Good! This is the assembly code that MASM will compile
when we resume the build.

<P>Down near the bottom we will find our function. Change the "12345678"
to "87654321".

<P>Save the file. We just overwrote the current ASM with the open file
in NotePad.

<P>Go back to VB and select the No button (didn't open with ASM editor)
or Yes to&nbsp; finish the compile.
<BR>(The button will depend on how you opened the file).

<P>Run the EXE... If all is well then the msgbox should have the reversed
number in it.

<P>If another change is desired, built the EXE again in VB. Breakpoint
pops, goto NotePad, make the changes.
<BR>(Just leave Notepad or your editor open when making many changes and
hit the "No" button when asked
<BR>if you want to open the file. This makes it quick to do changes.)

<P>Save the file overwriting the current one.

<P>Return to VB, click "No", and the compile finishes.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This could have been done in the VB module easier but I have found times
(with more complex code) that it is a handy
<BR>option to have. Especially when swapping in large blocks of code.....JS
